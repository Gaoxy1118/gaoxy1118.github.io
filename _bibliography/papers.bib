  abstract={Injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into gas reservoirs can achieve CO<sub>2</sub> Storage with enhanced gas recovery (CSEGR). The development of liquid-CO<sub>2</sub> injection has the characteristics of high injectability, high mobility ratio, and low diffusion coefficient. Therefore, this paper established a wellbore-reservoir-thermo-hydro-mechanical-diffusion (WR-THMD) multi-physics fully coupled model of the wellbore-reservoir system, and verified the model based on field and experimental data. The mass transfer, heat transfer, and gas physical property changes in the wellbore and reservoir during the injection of liquid-CO<sub>2</sub> were studied. The impact of different engineering parameters on improving CH<sub>4</sub> recovery and CO<sub>2</sub> storage is also discussed. The results show that the impact of the wellbore on the physical properties and phase state of CO<sub>2</sub> is crucial. The injection of liquid-CO<sub>2</sub> is beneficial to the storage of CO<sub>2</sub> and the displacement of CH<sub>4</sub>. Lowering the injection temperature will slightly improve the injectability of liquid-CO<sub>2</sub> and increase the CO<sub>2</sub> storage rate by 5.13%. Using a high injection mass flow rate will effectively raise CH<sub>4</sub> recovery rate by 15.60%, but it will weaken the injectability of CO<sub>2</sub> and cause CO<sub>2</sub> to break through in the production well prematurely. The research results provide important suggestions and theoretical support for the application of liquid-CO<sub>2</sub> injection on CSEGR.},

  abstract={CO<sub>2</sub> injection into the reservoir can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The thermophysical parameters and phase behavior of CO<sub>2</sub> are highly sensitive to pressure and temperature, resulting in drastic change in wellbore and reservoir, and thus affecting the CO<sub>2</sub> storage effect. To study the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> thermophysical properties and phase behavior on CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage, we established a fully coupled 1D+3D wellbore coupled 3D reservoir model. Based on the analysis of non–isothermal flow characteristics, CO<sub>2</sub> thermophysical properties and phase behavior, the influence of engineering parameters on the key factors of CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage is discussed. The findings indicate that the density and thermal capacity of CO<sub>2</sub> are the most important thermophysical parameters that affect wellhead pressure and bottomhole temperature respectively. The efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> storage is greatly influenced by the density and viscosity of CO<sub>2</sub>, more so than any other thermophysical parameters. CO<sub>2</sub> phase behavior and permeability change increase CO<sub>2</sub> seepage capacity by 3.50 % and 8.79 % respectively. Engineering parameters will affect the thermophysical properties and permeability of bottom–hole CO<sub>2</sub>, thereby affecting the injectability and storage efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub>. This research can offer suggestions and theoretical groundwork for the improved design of CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage.},

  abstract={As a means of delaying climate change, injecting carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into geological structures can be an effective carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) strategy. All geological structures are naturally spatial heterogeneity, which can significantly affect fluid flow and heat transfer, thereby affecting CO<sub>2</sub> storage. We modeled fluid flow and heat transfer in 12 CO<sub>2</sub> storage scenarios with spatially heterogeneous reservoirs using a thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) coupled model of a 3D wellbore-reservoir system. CO<sub>2</sub> injectability and distribution uniformity were studied in relation to reservoir vertical heterogeneity and interlayers. The optimization method of engineering parameters is discussed. Positive rhythm reservoirs exhibit more uniform CO<sub>2</sub> distribution laterally under gravity than reverse rhythm reservoirs. In high permeability ratio reservoirs, the low-temperature zone has a longer transfer distance and CO<sub>2</sub> is more likely to be injected, but channeling is prone to occur. Reservoir porosity has little effect on reservoir CO<sub>2</sub> injectability and temperature distribution. The interlayers will weaken the influence of gravity and reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> injectability while providing additional storage volume. Injecting CO<sub>2</sub> at a lower temperature and mass flow will increase injectability. The uniform distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> laterals is most effectively improved by hydraulic fracturing. Using low thermal conductivity materials for the wellbore insulation to reduce heat replenishment from the surrounding formation is critical.},

  abstract={Injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into geological formations can effectively slow down CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, during the injection process, the physical properties of CO<sub>2</sub> in the wellbore and reservoir change significantly, which will greatly affect the CO<sub>2</sub> geological storage effect, and even cause injection difficulties or leakage, and the risk of hydrate formation. Therefore, a wellbore-reservoir-thermo-hydro-mechanical (WR-THM) fully coupled model is established. The model considers the heat transfer between the wellbore and the surrounding formation, the coupling between the wellbore and the target reservoir, and the THM coupling process of various fluids in the reservoir. The CO<sub>2</sub> storage effect and possible risks under different engineering parameters were studied. The research results show that when the injection temperature is -10°C, there is a risk of hydrate formation at the bottom hole. Increasing the injected mass flow will greatly reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> injection capacity. Low-permeability reservoirs are not easy to inject, and CO<sub>2</sub> seeps uncontrollably into cap rock and base rock. The research results provide theoretical support for the safe and efficient geological storage of CO<sub>2</sub>.},
